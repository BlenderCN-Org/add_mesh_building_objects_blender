2017 Jul 20, version 0.4.4:
  * Fix normals for circular treads

2017 Jul 19, version 0.4.3:
  * Fix normals for housed I-beam stringers

2017 Jul 17:
  * Fix normals for housed C-beam stringers

2017 Jul 16:
  * Simplify overcomplicated basic-steel tread shape. A simple
    C-section should be enough.
  * Fix normals for tread bar types

2017 Jul 15:
  * Fix normals for all parallelepiped components and stringers,
    and classic and basic-steel tread types

2017 Jul 14:
  * Fix bar-2 tread type sections overflowing allocated area as number
    of sections is increased
  * Option to adjust circular rail thickness; the chosen value can now
    be applied to its vertical extent, regardless of differing slopes
    for inner and outer rails.
  * Taper is not actually supported for housed-open stringers

2017 Jul 13:
  * Add distributed option for circular stringers
  * Always allow setting of railing height even if not making them, since
    this affects posts and retainers too
  * Make proper posts, railings and retainers for circular stairs
  * Implement option for central pillar for circular stairs (checkbox
    was there before but didn’t do anything)
  * Fix normals for section meshes

2017 Jul 12, version 0.4:
  * Generated staircase components are now parented to an Empty
    for easier manipulation
  * Use appropriate property subtypes so percentages and angles are
    properly shown to user
  * Hide stringer options that are irrelevant to chosen stair type
  * Don’t hide properties that are relevant to circular stair type:
    number of stringers, use-original
  * Cut off protruding part of circular stringer at edge of topmost tread

2017 Jul 7:
  * remove functions available elsewhere (i.e. standard addons: Archimesh,
    Extra Objects)

2017 Jul 6, version 0.2:
  * initial rescue of code from dustbin of blender-addons-contrib repo
